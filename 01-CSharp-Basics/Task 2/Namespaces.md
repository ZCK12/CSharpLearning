`using System` - This is a directive that tells the compiler that we are using the `System` namespace. Namespaces contain groups of related classes and other types. The `System` namespace includes fundamental classes for handling things like input and output (I/O), basic types, conversions, math operations, and more. In other programs, you might see other `using` directives for other namespaces, depending on what functionality you need.
