Create a "Hello, World!" program. This is a traditional starting point for learning a new language and will help you understand the structure of a C# program.

```csharp 
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

References in the program:
- [[Namespaces|using System;]] 
- [[Classes|class Program]]
- [[Syntactic Elements|{ } Syntax]]
- [[Main ( )|static void Main ( )]]
- [[Console WriteLine|Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");]]

In most programs, you'll find similar structuresâ€”the use of namespaces to access classes and types, class definitions, method definitions, and method calls. The complexity and size of the class and method bodies will increase with the complexity of the tasks you're trying to perform. But at their core, all C# programs build upon these fundamental concepts.
