`static void Main()`: This line declares the `Main` method, which is the entry point of any C# console application. When the program runs, this is the first method that gets called. The keyword `static` means that this method belongs to the class itself, not to an instance of the class. The `void` keyword indicates that `Main` does not return a value. In other variations of C# programs, such as those with a graphical user interface (GUI), the entry point might be set up differently, but there will always be a main entry point where the application starts.
