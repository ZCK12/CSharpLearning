`class Program`: This line declares a class named `Program`. A class is a blueprint from which objects are created. In C#, every piece of code lives inside a class or struct, and `Program` is the standard name for the entry class that contains the entry point of the program. In other programs, classes are named according to what they represent or manage (e.g., `Customer`, `Order`, `FileReader`).
