`Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");` This line of code is a method call. It tells the program to write the line "Hello, World!" to the console. The `Console` class is part of the `System` namespace, which we referenced with `using System;` at the top of the file. The `Console` class provides basic support for applications that read characters from and write characters to the console. The `WriteLine` method prints out a line of text followed by a line break. In other programs, you might use different methods of the `Console` class to read input or write output in various formats.
