Variables are the basic units of storage in a program. In C#, every variable has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.

Here are the basic data types in C#:

- `int`: Stores 32-bit integers. Example: `int score = 10;`
- `double`: Stores double-precision floating-point numbers. Example: `double pi = 3.14159;`
- `char`: Stores a single 16-bit Unicode character. Example: `char initial = 'A';`
- `string`: Stores a sequence of characters. Example: `string name = "Alice";`
- `bool`: Stores a Boolean value, true or false. Example: `bool isDone = false;`

In addition to these basic types, C# also provides a range of other types for more specific or complex needs, such as `float` for single-precision floating-point numbers, `long` for larger integers, `decimal` for financial and monetary calculations, and so on.
