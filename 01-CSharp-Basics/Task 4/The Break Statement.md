The `break` statement is used to terminate a loop immediately.

- `if (userInput.Trim().ToLower() == "quit") { break; }`: This line checks if the user's input is "quit" (the input is trimmed of whitespace and converted to lowercase to ensure the comparison works regardless of the input's case or spacing). If it is "quit", the `break` statement exits the `for` loop.
