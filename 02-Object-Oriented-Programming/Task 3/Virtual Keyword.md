The `virtual` keyword in C# is used to modify a method, property, indexer, or event declaration and allow for it to be overridden in a derived class. When a base class uses `virtual`, it's signaling that the entity can be re-implemented by a derived class to provide specialized behavior.

Here are the key implications of the `virtual` keyword:

- **Overridability**: A `virtual` member signifies that the derived classes have the option to override it with their own implementation.
- **Polymorphism**: It enables polymorphism, where a call to a `virtual` method will execute the most derived implementation of the method for the object's runtime type, which can be different from the compile-time type.
- **Inheritance**: Only methods in a class that are declared as `virtual` can be overridden in subclasses. Non-virtual methods cannot be overridden, protecting them from changes in subclasses.
- **Late Binding**: When you call a `virtual` method, the runtime looks up the method's implementation at runtime rather than compile time. This process is known as late binding or dynamic dispatch.
- **Base Implementation**: The base class can still provide a default implementation for a `virtual` method, which derived classes can use if they don't need to provide a specialized implementation.
- **Extensibility**: It allows classes to be extended and modified in future versions without breaking existing code, as subclasses can override the behavior of virtual methods to provide new functionality.

Use of the `virtual` keyword is a fundamental part of designing extensible, object-oriented systems in C#.
