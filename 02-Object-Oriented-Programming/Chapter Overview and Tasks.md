### Classes and Objects

- **Concept**: A class is a blueprint for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class.
- **Task**: Create a simple `Car` class with properties like `Make`, `Model`, and `Year`. Then, instantiate it to create a `Car` object.

### Properties and Methods

- **Concept**: Properties allow you to control the accessibility of a class's fields. Methods define the behavior or actions of a class.
- **Task**: Add properties to your `Car` class with getters and setters. Also, add a method to display information about the car.

### Inheritance

- **Concept**: Inheritance allows a class (child) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent).
- **Task**: Create a `ElectricCar` class that inherits from the `Car` class and adds a new property for `BatteryLevel`.

### Polymorphism

- **Concept**: Polymorphism lets you use a class in many forms, often through method overriding or interfaces.
- **Task**: define an interface named `IChargeable` with a method signature `ChargeBattery()` that sets the battery level of an ElectricCar to 100.

### Encapsulation

- **Concept**: Encapsulation is about hiding the internal state of an object and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods.
- **Task**: Ensure all fields in your `Car` class are private and can only be accessed through properties.

### Projects

- **Concept**: Apply what you've learned in a project.
- **Task**: Build a simple application where you can add different types of vehicles to a list, displaying all their info.
