The `get` and `set` keywords are part of a property in C#. Properties are a special kind of class member that provides a flexible mechanism to read, write, or compute the value of a private field. Properties can be used as if they are public data members, but they are actually special methods called accessors. This enables data to be accessed easily while still providing the safety and flexibility of methods.

Here's what `get` and `set` do:

- **`get` Accessor**: The `get` accessor is used to return the property value. It's similar to a method that returns a value. When you have a `get` accessor in a property, it means you can read the value of the property.

- **`set` Accessor**: The `set` accessor is used to assign a new value to the property. It includes an implicit parameter named `value`, which is of the same type as the property. A `set` accessor indicates that you can assign a value to the property.


For example, consider a property `Age` in a class:
```csharp
private int age;

public int Age
{
    get { return age; } // Get the value of age.
    set { age = value; } // Set a new value to age.
}
```

- The `age` field is private, meaning it can't be accessed directly from outside the class. This encapsulates the field and protects it from invalid values and unauthorized access.
- The `Age` property provides a way to get and set the value of `age` safely.
- When you write `myObject.Age = 30;`, the `set` accessor is invoked with `value` being `30`.
- When you read the property with `int myAge = myObject.Age;`, the `get` accessor is invoked.

Properties enable encapsulation by keeping fields private while providing public accessors. This is a key aspect of object-oriented programming because it allows for control over the data and can include logic to validate the data being set or to modify how data is returned when it's accessed.

For example, if you want to ensure that the `Year` property always has a sensible value, you might do something like this:

```csharp
private int year;

public int Year
{
    get { return year; }
    set
    {
        if (value > 0) // Simple validation to ensure the year is positive.
            year = value;
        else
            throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(nameof(value), "Year must be positive.");
    }
}
```

In this example, the `set` accessor is doing some validation before assigning a value to the private `year` field. This encapsulates the logic for managing the year within the `Year` property itself.

Properties themselves can be public, private, protected, internal, or protected internal, just like methods and fields. The access level of the property determines how it can be accessed from other parts of your program.

Similarly, you can have different access levels for `get` and `set`:
```csharp
public string Make { get; private set; }
```

Here, `Make` can be read by anyone but can only be set within the class itself (`private set`), providing more control over how the value is changed.
